# Laravvel VueJs Task App

## Install

1. Clone the repository
   ```git clone https://github.com/LoveAndHappiness/Laravel-Vue-TaskApp.git```
2. Run Composer from the Command Line
   ```composer install```
3. Install Node Packages for Vue, Vue-resource, Gulp, Bootstrap and Laravel Elixir
   ```npm install```
4. Compile Javascript and Sass Files
   ```gulp```


## Explanation

It is just a simple Task App thats fetches (get), adds (post), edits (update) and deletes (delete) tasks from a mySQL database.

I made it as a personal guideline to build more complicated apps using Vue and hope to improve this simple task app in future commits, to increase performance of multiple http requests, which at the moment are fired each time I make a change right now.

I would welcome improvements.
